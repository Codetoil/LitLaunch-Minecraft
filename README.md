# tpsmodsrc
This is the source to the TPS Mod. This is currently only the dev source, sorry! Once the new update is released, I may be able to have a special branch for non-dev. That's for later though!

## development info
To install, put this into the src folder of a brand new 1.7, 1.8, 1.12, or 1.13 workspace. You will see compile errors, and that's because a 1.7, 1.8, 1.12, and 1.13 "mod" is enabled by default. Them importing unknown classes to versions other than the intended one causes the problem.
To fix this in eclipse, disable the versions you aren't looking at by right clicking the package, and under "Build Path", click "exclude". 
I don't know how to do it in IntelliJ as I don't use it. Hopefully someone does... so if there is an "exclude"-like option, use that! If not, follow through with the one for no IDE.
If you're using no IDE, just change the ".java" extensions to something like ".java1" to disable the classes.
# Pull request format and acceptability
Before pull requesting, please change all extensions of java-type files back to ".java". Make sure the new workspace compiles for all four versions!

Once reviewed, the pull request might be accepted or declined based on whether the code is with the rules of the mod.
## the rules of the mod
-Don't change the code to:
	-harm someone
	-harm a group of people
	-harm the public
-Don't change the code to give yourself an advantage over someone else in any way, besides the ability to see the tps. I'm not making this mod a cheat mod!
-All changes in the code must not change anything gameplaywise. Again, I'm not making this mod a cheat mod!

###This is not an inclusive list and I may have rules not written down here.

## Free speech - But keep on topic.
In the discussion pages, you may speak whatever you want, as long as it complies to the topic. This allows for naughty language in the discussion pages. People who are off topic may be punished though, so stay on topic!
The free speach statement can be overriden by Github's own rules if it has any against free speech, though off-topic-ness is still punished.

Thank you and have fun modding!
