v1.2 of TPSMod is included on a seperate branch and in the tpsmodsrc-1.2/main folder. 

## Installing development enviorment
Simple `git clone` the repo!

You may have to modify some of the build.gradle(s) so that the build doesn't reference D:/ and C:/

# Pull request format and acceptability

Once reviewed, the pull request might be accepted or declined based on whether the code is with the rules of the mod.

## the rules of the mod

-Don't change the code to:

-harm someone

-harm a group of people

-harm the public
	
-Don't change the code to give yourself an advantage over someone else in any way. I'm not making this mod a hacked client!

-All changes in the code must not change anything gameplaywise. Again, I'm not making this mod a hacked client!

### This is not an inclusive list and I may have rules not written down here.

## Free speech - But keep on topic.
In the discussion pages, you may speak whatever you want, as long as it complies to the topic. This allows for naughty language in the discussion pages. People who are off topic may be punished though, so stay on topic!
The free speach statement can be overriden by Github's own rules if it has any against free speech, though off-topic-ness is still punished.

Thank you and have fun modding!
